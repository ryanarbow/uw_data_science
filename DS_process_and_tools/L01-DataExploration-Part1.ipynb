    "# Lesson 1 - Exploration of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains an introduction to the methods data scientists use to prepare and explore a data set. Data scientists spend a lot of time manipulating data to clean and prepare it (**data munging**) and to understand the relationships within the variables in the data (**data exploration**). Visualization is a key skill for any data scientist performing these tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before performing any type of inference or machine learning on a data set, you should develop an understanding of the relationships in the data set. Skipping this step can lead wasted time from unexpected problems when building models, or in constructing models with poor performance. When starting any data science project, it is a good idea to plan on spending considerable time exploring the data. These exploration steps are often performed in conjunction with data cleaning and preparing, as visualization often highlights problems with data. \n",
    "\n",
    "These lessons are divided into several parts. In each part you will learn how to use the visualization tools available in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Summarizing and manipulating data**:\n",
    "  * How large is it?\n",
    "  * What columns are of interest?\n",
    "  * Missing data?\n",
    "  * What are the characteristics of the data derived from summary statistics and counts?\n",
    "- **Overview of Matplotlib, Pandas plotting and Seaborn** is a review of commonly used Python plotting packages. \n",
    "- **Overview of univariate plot types** is a review of creating these basic plots using three Python packages. These plot types allow you to study the distributional properties of the variables in your data set. \n",
    "- **Using Matplotlib methods** reviews ways to add attributes to plots, such as titles and axis labels. "

    "1. The bold line in the box shows the median of the distribution. \n",

    "3. The length of the whiskers is the lesser of +/-2.5 times the inter-quartile range (about 2.7 times the standard deviation) or the most extreme values of the data. \n",
    "4. Outliers are shown by symbols, such as `+` or `*`, beyond the whiskers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Box plots are best used to compare distributions of a variable grouped by another variable. In this case, several box plots can be stacked along an axis. The data are divided using a 'group by' operation, and the box plots for each group are stacked next to each other. In this way, the box plot allows you to display two dimensions of your data set. \n",
