    "# Lesson 4 - Sampling and Law of Large Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling is a fundamental process in the collection of data. Sampling is important because we can almost never look at the whole population. Some key points to keep in mind about sampling are:\n",
    "- An understanding of sampling is essential to ensure that analyses performed are representative of the entire population. \n",
    "- You will use inferences on the sample to say something about the population.\n",
    "- You will need estimates of variances on the sample calculations to say something about the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at some examples of sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Use Case | Sample | Population |\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| A/B Testing | The users we show either web sites A or B | All possible users, past present and future|\n",
    "|World Cup Soccer | 32 teams which qualify in one season | All national teams in past, present and future years|\n",
    "|Average height of data science students | Students in UW Data Science Program | All students taking data science classes world wide|\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice, that in several cases it is not only impractical, but impossible to collect data from the entire population. Hence, we must work with correctly collected samples. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Sampling Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "At the conclusion of this lesson, you should be able to apply a number of commonly used sampling strategies: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Bernoulli Sampling\n",
    "- Stratified Sampling\n",
    "- Cluster Sampling\n",
    "- Systematic Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bernoulli Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernoulli sampling has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All population members have equal an chance of being part of the sample. \n",
    "- The sample sizes in Bernoulli sampling are not fixed, because each sample is considered separately. \n",
    "An example would be to randomly products in a factory to ensure quality.\n",
    "Let's look at an example. The code in the cell below creates a data frame with 200 random samples of a normal distribution, divided into 4 groups. Run this code and examine the summary of the sample. "
