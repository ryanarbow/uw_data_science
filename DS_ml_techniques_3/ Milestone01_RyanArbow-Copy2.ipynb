For example, if you did something one way but are unsure if there might be a different or better way to do it, ask for feedback on that part. You may submit these questions by commenting out in the code within your .ipynb file or by typing them below your file name in the Your Response box on the Submit Milestone Assignment page. While the questions you submit will have no bearing on your grade, by doing so, you will engage more actively with the assignment and we will also be able to give you pointed feedback."
